For this homework assignment in python-challenge we were able to look at two different CSV files and use our python skills to complete the assignment. The first file was budget data where we able to calculate:

The total number of months included in the dataset
net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period

For the second CSV file we looked into election data and were able to find the:
The total number of votes casted
complete list of candidates who received votes
percentage of votes each candidate won
total number of votes each candidate won
winner of the election based on popular vote
